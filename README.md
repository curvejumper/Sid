Sid: The Simple Intelligent Device
Sid is a personal project that takes off from the wonderfully made [Jasper voice computing platform](https://github.com/jasperproject)

Instead of using your voice to control your computer, this currently uses text messages to communicate to the user.

## Goal

The goal of the project is to create a application that interfaces with the core of the program to relay more 
complicated commands. As of right now, texting is limited due to limits from carriers and the gmail gateway it uses

## The future for this project

This is my first personal project and because of that, it needs a lot of cleaning up. The program itself runs smoothly
on a Raspberry Pi microprossesing board, but the code is a little messy still. 
I plan to clean it up as much as I can whenever I can. You may fork the project and tinker with it as you please.

## Contact
You may contact me on the email provided in my profile for any questions on the project. 
I will help or accept comments always.
